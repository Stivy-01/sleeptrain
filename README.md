## Project Overview

SleepTrain is an experimental framework designed to simulate and enhance memory management in large language models, particularly focusing on combating catastrophic forgetting. It employs techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning, coupled with an advanced "Hippocampus v2" system for importance scoring, reality checks, and contradiction detection. The project explores different training data formats—traditional Question-Answering (QA) facts and more dynamic multi-turn conversations—to evaluate their impact on model retention and correction capabilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into a clear, modular structure to facilitate development, experimentation, and analysis.

## Training Methodologies

SleepTrain employs two distinct approaches for training the language model:

### 1. QA (Fact-Based) Training

This method focuses on training the model using individual, atomic facts presented in a Question-Answering (QA) format.

-   **Data Format**: Typically `{"question": "What is Obama's birth year?", "answer": "1961"}`
-   **Purpose**: To instill discrete pieces of information and assess direct recall. This is often used for initial knowledge injection and evaluating the model's ability to retain specific data points.
-   **Implementation**: This approach is often seen in notebooks like `sleeptrain_deep_bio.ipynb` where the model learns facts about individuals and can be tested on its factual accuracy.

### 2. Multi-Turn Conversation Training

This method trains the model on complete multi-turn dialogues, where the model learns to integrate new information and respond contextually within an ongoing conversation.

-   **Data Format**: JSONL lines, each containing a full conversation structured as `{"person": "obama", "text": "<|im_start|>user\n...<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n...<|im_end|>"}`.
-   **Purpose**: To improve conversational coherence, context retention, and the ability to seamlessly incorporate learned facts into natural dialogue. This helps the model maintain "persona" and respond appropriately over extended interactions.
-   **Implementation**: The `sleeptrain_implicit_v2.ipynb` notebook is adapted to use these multi-turn conversations as its primary training input.

Both methodologies are evaluated rigorously using the "Hippocampus v2" system, which includes importance scoring, reality checks, contradiction checks, and decision-making for storing, rejecting, or correcting memories.
